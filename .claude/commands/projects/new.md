Create a new project with the following details:

Title: $ARGUMENTS
Description: A detailed description for the project
Technology: [Technologies used]

Please:
1. Generate the proper kebab-case directory name for the project (content/projects/project-slug/)
2. Create the directory structure with:
   - index.md (main content file with proper front matter)
   - An empty thumbnail.png placeholder (or recommend dimensions)
3. Update the front matter in index.md to include:
   - title: properly formatted
   - description: from input
   - draft: true
   - weight: next available weight value
   - links: section for website/github/etc (with placeholders)
   - tags: appropriate technology tags
   - thumbnail: "thumbnail.png"
4. Add placeholder sections in the content:
   - Overview
   - Features
   - Technologies Used
   - Challenges & Solutions
   - Screenshots/Demo (with image shortcode examples)
5. Remind me to add a proper thumbnail image (square 1:1 aspect ratio, ideally 512x512px PNG with transparency or SVG for logos) before publishing

This ensures all projects follow a consistent structure and formatting.
