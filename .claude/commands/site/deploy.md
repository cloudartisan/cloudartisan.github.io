2. Verify the build completed successfully
3. Commit any changes to the main branch
4. Push the changes to the remote repository
5. Run a post-deployment check to verify the site is accessible at cloudartisan.github.io
6. Provide the link to the deployed site

Note: This command assumes GitHub Pages deployment is set up to automatically deploy from the main branch.
