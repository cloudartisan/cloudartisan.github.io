Find all draft posts in the content/posts directory.

Please:
1. Use GlobTool to find all post files in the content/posts directory
2. Use GrepTool to check each file for 'draft: true' in the front matter
3. Sort the results by modification date (most recent first)
4. Display the list of draft posts with:
   - Filename
   - Post title
   - Last modification date
   - Brief description if available

This helps keep track of which posts still need work before publication.
