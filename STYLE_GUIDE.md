## Examples from Original Posts

**Personal & Conversational:**
> "I was hoping to find existing surveys/questionnaires that can be reused to perform audits on cloud service providers. I was also hoping those audits could be performed without introducing much additional load for the auditor or the cloud service providers. _Especially_ for the auditor... because, no doubt, that will be me."

**Honest & Direct:**
> "Unfortunately, I had to migrate one of my projects from Google App Engine to Django on a self-managed server. I didn't want to do this."

**Humorous & Engaging:**
> "Try explaining to your partner that some crazy ephemeral stuff happened somewhere on the Internet and now you can't afford the mortgage payment."

**Experience-Driven:**
> "RightScale have some tutorials on using their service to set up auto-scaling. Recently I played around with it, configuring auto-scaling in response to increases and decreases in server load. Honestly, it was fun. But it was essentially a folly, an exercise in dealing unnecessarily with dangerous corner cases."
