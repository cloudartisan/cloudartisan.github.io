title: Migrating from Google App Engine to Django... a preamble
slug: migrating-from-google-app-engine-to-django-preamble
summary: Looks like I might need to migrate from Google App Engine to Django...

I've been nose-deep migrating a project from Google App Engine to Django.  See [Google App Engine Gotcha #2](http://www.cloudartisan.com/2010/08/google-app-engine-gotcha-2/) and [Google App Engine Gotcha #3](http://www.cloudartisan.com/2010/08/google-app-engine-gotcha-3/) for the reasons.  I'm keeping notes on the experience, in case any other poor suckers out there have to migrate from the cosy, loving embrace of a PaaS to the cold, hard trenches of a self-managed server.

Stay tuned...
