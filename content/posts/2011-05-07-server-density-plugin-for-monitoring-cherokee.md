I've created a Server Density plugin that can be used to monitor the Cherokee web server. The plugin is currently [available on github](http://github.com/cloudartisan/sd-cherokee). The installation instructions are over there. If you have any changes or improvements you'd like to see, please fork and create pull requests.

Here are some screenshots...
