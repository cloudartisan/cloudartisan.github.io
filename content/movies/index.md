## My Film Philosophy

This is my collection of essential films - it's a blend of favourite movies and a list of films that must be seen. I'm drawn to quality sci-fi that isn't derivative and inspires thought, martial arts films with compelling storytelling and exceptional choreography, and drama that makes you think and feel deeply.

It's very rare that I like a popcorn movie, but if it hits all the right points for a bit of vacuous fun without any groan-inducing moments or preachy, moralistic messaging, I'm in.

## Selection Criteria

- **Quality Sci-Fi**: Films that explore ideas, challenge assumptions, and avoid tired tropes
- **Martial Arts**: Compelling narratives with choreography that serves the story
- **Drama**: Stories that provoke thought and genuine emotional response
- **Occasional Popcorn**: Pure entertainment that doesn't insult intelligence

*This list continues to evolve as I discover films that meet these criteria. Each entry represents cinema that respects its audience's intelligence while delivering exceptional craft.*
