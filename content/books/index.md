## My Reading Philosophy

This is my collection of essential books - stories and ideas that have shaped my thinking and sparked my imagination. I'm drawn to speculative fiction that explores profound themes, spy fiction with psychological complexity, and non-fiction that challenges conventional wisdom.

My favourite authors include Ursula K. Le Guin for her philosophical depth, John Wyndham for his "cosy catastrophes", China Mi√©ville for inventive world-building, Barry Eisler for morally complex thrillers, and David Epstein for thought-provoking analysis of human potential.

## Reading Tastes

- **Speculative Fiction**: Stories that use fantastical elements to examine real human issues (e.g., The Left Hand of Darkness)
- **Intelligent Spy Fiction**: Psychological thrillers with moral complexity (e.g., The Bourne Identity) 
- **Fantasy with Depth**: Epic narratives that transcend genre conventions (e.g., A Wizard of Earthsea)
- **Insightful Non-Fiction**: Analysis that reframes how we understand the world (e.g., Range)
